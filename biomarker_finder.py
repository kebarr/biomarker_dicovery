""" Spreadsheet format: one spreadsheet per condition, i.e. early vs late, etc. conditions are labelled Group A and Group B
There can be different numbers of replicates, so need to count how many columns for group A and how many for group B
For each subtype, assuming we are doing 2 v 2 comparisons, there are 4 condition spreadsheets.
Format will be xlsx
Assume that header is always 2 lines, first line, ignore
